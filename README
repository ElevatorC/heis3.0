## Important if you ARE going to code on this project
Code conventions:
- Code is coded in english
* Only small letters in filename no symbols whitespaces or numbers
	* myfile.c
	* myheader.h
- File and header name should be the same
- CamelCase for variableNames
- Underscore for function_names 
* for typer use type_t
	* struct myType_t
	* enum my_enum_t
* Big letters for #define's and ENUM's
	* #define CONSTANT 5

Name Explenations:
- ui=user interface
- sm=state machine
- elev=elevator
- queues = queue system

Class syntax:
* (filename)_function_name();

Spesification requirement not achived in FAT test:
- The elevator doesn't know which too floors it is in between.

Solution: sm_stop takes in a previousState parameter:
- It uses ui_get_floor_indicator and previousState to calculate which floors it is between and then goes to the correct action.
